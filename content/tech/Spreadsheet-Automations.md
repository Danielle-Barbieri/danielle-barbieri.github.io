Google sheets and Excel can be enabled to do highly functional tasks. 

Many small companies face the following:

- Lack of cash flow to afford programs that help with cross-team communication, like a CRM
- Use of several forms that require manual inputs
- Due to lack of automation, information may not be up to date or filled in

- More automated
- More collaborative
- Easier to keep up-to-date

In my google sheets series, I'll present: 

- Formulas to create automations
- Scripts to create automations
- Zapier workflows to bring many of your programs into one sheet
