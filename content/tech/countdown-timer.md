Creating your own project is the best way to learn a tech skill. It's also a great way to show potential employers that you know a skill, especially if you do not have formal experience in that role. 

I set out to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript about 2 years ago. The "Countdown Timer" below is the first project I created. In doing so, I not only learned how to write some code, but also learned how to use VSCode and GitHub.

The following websites, which offer free and paid content, helped me learn: 

- Codecademy
- flexboxfroggy
