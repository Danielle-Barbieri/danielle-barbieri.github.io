Recently, many therapists have reached out to ask me how I transitioned into non-clinical work. My intention with this post is to list my journey. That way, when we do talk, we can skip my background and jump into your questions.

## Burnout

Covid hit in the beginning of my second year as an occupational therapist and most likely accelerated my feelings of burnout. There are things that I love about clinical practice, but my dislikes with clincial practice started to become overpowering.

**The Good**

- You get to build relationships with people and help them
- The day moves fast when you are seeing patients all day
- In general, contract and per-diem work have high hourly rates
- With per-diem and contract work, you may have a degree of control over your schedule

**The Bad**

- Work is only considered payable when you're face to face with clients, leading to high productivity standards
- There is limited upword mobility in salary and job title
- Your income may not be predictable, with so many jobs not paying for travel, cancellations, notes, etc
- Most jobs are not flexible
- Full-time, W2 positions are far and few between

## Continued Learning

**Aspireship**

This is the program that initiated my non-clinical journey. I bought this subscription 7 months before landing my first internship.

The base subscription grants you access to a ton of foundational courses for only $180. Their “Customer Success Foundations” courseprovides you with a certificate after passing a test. 

I recommend this subscription early in your journey to learn technology terms, SaaS processes, and to learn about different professions in the tech realm. 

This course was unable to help me translate my clinical skills into non-clinical terms, which is why I decided to seek addiitonal assistance.

**Collective Coaching**

This is the second program I joined, 3 months before landing my first internship. 

This course is run by 2 occupational therapists who transitioned into tech, so it is truly geared towards clinicians. It is important for therapists who are looking for a coaching program to seek assistance from people who understand your skills, which is why I recommend this program for therapists who are just getting started on their journey to non clinical work.

This program directly connected me to my internship, which turned into my first digital health job.


**Carly Agar Customer Success Intensive** 

This is the most recent program I joined, after landing my first internship. This program has helped me improve my resume and land interviews. The program is tailored towards customer success, but I beleieve the skills you learn about technical resumes and interviewing can be used for any job.

Though she is not a therapist, Carly has helped many PT's and OT’s land jobs in tech. I truly believe she understands our job description, and how to display the skills we already have to successfully land jobs.

**Moving Forward**

It’s important to keep learning even after you get your big break. There is so much to learn, and there are so many cheap ways to do it. I continue to leverage my network to ask their opinions on whether or not I am taking the correct approach. Also, I continue to take courses on Udemy to upskill.


## Summary
As you can see, it may take an investment to successfully make this transition. I hope you’re able to choose which of these programs works best for you, and avoid spending money on programs that do not.

Talk Soon,
