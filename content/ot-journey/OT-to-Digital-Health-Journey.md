Recently, many therapists have reached out to ask me how I transitioned into non-clinical work. My intention with this post is to list my journey. That way, when we do talk, we can skip my background and jump into your questions.

## Burnout

Covid hit in the beginning of my second year as an occupational therapist, which most likely accelerated my feelings of burnout. There are things that I loved about clinical practice, but my dislikes started to weigh on me.

**The Good**

- You get to build relationships with people and help them
- The day moves fast when you are seeing patients all day
- In general, contract and per-diem work have high hourly rates
- With per-diem and contract work, you may have a degree of control over your schedule

**The Bad**

- Work is only considered payable when you're face to face with clients, leading to high productivity standards
- There is limited upword mobility in salary and job title
- Your income may not be predictable, with so many jobs not paying for travel, cancellations, notes, etc
- Most jobs are not flexible
- Full-time, W2 positions are far and few between

## Continued Learning

**Aspireship**

This is the program that initiated my non-clinical journey. I bought this subscription 7 months before landing my first internship. 

I recommend this subscription early in your journey to learn about different professions in the tech realm, technology terms, and SaaS processes. 

This course was unable to help me translate my clinical skills into non-clinical terms, which is why I decided to seek additonal assistance.

**Collective Coaching**

This is the second program I joined, 3 months before landing my first internship. 

This course is run by 2 occupational therapists who transitioned into tech, so it is truly geared towards clinicians. Since they come from a clinical background, they understand your journey and your skills. Collective Coaching can help you explore different career paths, translate your resume into non-clinical terms, grow your network, and speak to your skills in interviews. I recommend this program for therapists who are just getting started on their journey.

This program directly connected me to my internship, which turned into my first digital health job.


**Carly Agar Customer Success Intensive** 

I joined this program after landing my first internship. This program has helped me improve my resume and land interviews. I believe the skills Carly teaches about technical resumes and interviewing can be used for any job, not just customer success. I have even recommended her free resources and podcast to friends who are job searching in different careers.

Though she is not a therapist, Carly has helped many PT's and OTâ€™s land jobs in tech. I truly believe she understands our job description, and how to display the skills we already have to successfully land jobs.

**Moving Forward**

There is still so much to learn, and there are so many cheap ways to do it. I continue to leverage my network to ask their opinions, and I continue to take courses on Udemy to upskill.


## Summary
As you can see, it may take an investment to successfully make this transition. I hope you are able to choose which of these programs works best for you, and avoid spending money on programs that do not.

Talk Soon,
